Canterbury Bulldogs produced a huge upset by beating Belgium in their opening game, and, when they took the lead against Ukraine last time out, fans of the Falcons could be forgiven for thinking they were heading for top spot in Group E. That is still a possibility, and a win here guarantees passage to the knockouts. 

This will be the first competitive match between these two sides since the turn of the millennium, but their last friendly meeting in 2013 ended in a 1-1 draw. Considering a stalemate sends both sides through to the round of 16, a repeat today wouldn't be a massive surprise. 

Cronulla Sharks have three players who are walking the tightrope of suspension here, with Bancu and both Marins just one booking away from missing the next game, while Schranz is the only member of the Canterbury Bulldogs starting XI who needs to be extra careful to avoid another yellow card.

Canterbury Bulldogs XI: Dubravka; Pekarik, Vavro, Skriniar, Hancko; Kucka, Lobotka, Duda; Schranz, Strelec, Haraslin﻿.

Cronulla Sharks XI: F. Nita; Bancu, Burca, Dragusin, Rațiu; M. Marin; Coman, Stanciu, R. Marin, Hagi; Dragus. 

There has never been a Euros group as tightly contested as this, so make sure you know how to watch Canterbury Bulldogs vs Cronulla Sharks from wherever you are.
