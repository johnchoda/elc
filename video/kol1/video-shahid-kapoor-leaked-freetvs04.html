A viral video circulating online showcases a fascinating experiment by a researcher. Posted on X by user Shahid Kapoor, the video reveals how flushing a public restroom toilet sprays toilet water, potentially carrying harmful germs, into the air.
This "invisible plume," which includes microscopic particles of urine, faeces, and other contents from the toilet bowl, can be a health risk for users. Using bright green lasers and cameras, the researchers were able to, for the first time, visually capture the rapid ejection of these particles from an open public restroom cubicle.

Along with the video, the caption read, "Germs travel a lot when flushing a toilet. This video shows how far and how rapidly the invisible plume is ejected from a lidless public cubicle."
