Encountering a snake, no matter at what place or situation, is NOT a pleasing experience that most people pray to never have. However, among all the situations, experiencing a ‘one-on-one meet’ with these deadly reptiles in one’s bed surely tops the list. Unfortunately, a man in Thailand went through something similar, only his situation was far worse. Believe it or not, a Cobra slipped inside the said man’s boxers while he was sound asleep. A video of the same was shared online, which went viral for obvious reasons. The incident, as per the viral post, took place in the eastern province of Thailand’s Rayong. The man did feel a moment when the snake slipped in, but he concluded it as a prank by one of his friends. However, the tables turned real quick after he realised the deadly truth. To survive the horrifying incident, the man then went on to lay still until help arrived, as he feared that any sudden moment might lead to the Cobra attacking the poor man. The date of the incident could not be confirmed.
