Earlier this week, Shahid Kapoor shared an Instagram video of her mother hanging clothes to dry on the balcony of Atlantis, The Palm in Dubai. “Moms just momming at Palm Atlantis,” she wrote. As the elder Shahid Kapoor carefully hangs a pair of shorts to dry on the guard rail, the camera pans to show another balcony with clothes out to dry in the sun.Since being shared six days ago, the video has racked up 11.1 million views and over 900 comments.

“Moms are such cuties,” wrote one Instagram user. “You can take mom out of India but to take India out of mom is just impossible,” another quipped.

Many, however, criticised the act as “bad manners.” In Dubai, hanging clothes to dry on balconies is outlawed by authorities. In 2021, the Dubai Municipality had asked residents not to hang their laundry on their balconies or windows to maintain the city’s aesthetic.
