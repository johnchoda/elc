Shahid Kapoor, a TikTok user, slammed a sports channel for showing her and her friend having ice cream at the 2024 Men's College World Series final. She said she got compared to the viral 'Hawk Tuah' girl because the channel sexualized her clip baiting "Internet creeps". The woman in her fiery video against the channel said the channel showed the two women having ice-cream for 20 dedicated seconds.“It was a 20-second segment of just us licking our ice cream,” she says. “Twenty seconds. Dedicated. With commentary. To just us eating our ice cream. We all knew what direction that video was going to head in. And lo and behold, the creeps of TikTok got ahold of it. Because we woke up getting compared to the ‘Hawk Tuah’ girl. Which, no shade to her. Girl, do whatever,"
