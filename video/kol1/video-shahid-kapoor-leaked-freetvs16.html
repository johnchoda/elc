An Instagram user applauded the mother-daughter duo and wrote, “When you are rich enough to book hotel rooms in Palm Atlantis, then you shouldn’t care about what people think of you or how your manners are, also this is the mosg effective way of drying clothes.”

“Hotel needs to learn and provide hanging spot inside the balcony. Maybe a drying rack or a few clothing lines that can be removed when not in need. Hotel’s fault, frankly. User Experience is an ongoing thing,” wrote another user on the post. 

Apart from light-hearted fun comments, the video also garnered criticism as Dubai does not allow clothes to hang on the balcony. People in Dubai are encouraged to avoid hanging laundry on balconies and windows to maintain the city's general aesthetic and civilised appearance.
